JetBrains Academy Project - Car Sharing

Design of a car rental console application with simple functionalities such as:
- Customer service
- Rental service
- Car service

Concepts learned during the study and used in the project:
- DAO pattern
- Relational databases 
- SQL
- H2 database

Due to the flawed and problematic tests created by JetBrains for this project, I was quite limited in matters of using functional interfaces or at least simple inheritance which required adding a bit of redundant code.
